## 30 Day Map Challenge
(<a href="https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge">what is the 30 day map challenge?</a>)

<p style="font-size:large">November 11: 3D

<img src="images/stpauls1.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">Not a lot of 3D maps in my current role so I took the opportunity to try out a new piece of software, <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod">AerialOD</a>, after seeing it all over the #30DayMapChallenge hashtag. It's a neat program, very powerful, and somewhat Blenderesque. I grabbed some LIDAR from the <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/DefraDataDownload/?Mode=survey">UK Department of Environmental Food and Rural Affairs' website</a> and messed around until I got something that looked all right. 

<p style="font-size:large">November 10: Grid

<img src="images/gridiron.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">I had oral surgery this morning and just wasn't feeling the grid theme or putting much energy into anything other than crawling back into bed, so I went in another direction and did grid...iron orientations. I thought there might be some patterns or something evident here. Nope! Not really. Question marks are domes where orientation was unclear (the Las Vegas Raiders' dome wasn't built yet at the time google earth's image was taken, which is fine because that dome doesn't open).

  <p style="font-size:xx-small">unlabeled version, the lines are clearer. 
  <br><br>
 <p style="font-size:13px">I also thought the Bills' stadium might stick out more. The stadium was built on land that includes a cemetery, 
   and the descendents of those interred there refused to allow the graves to be moved (this is not a Poltergeist situation, the headstones are still there). As a result, the stadium was not constructed North-South as originally planned but on a more East-West tilt, which allows for a vicious crosswind off Lake Erie (3.75 miles due west) to keep Bills fans' beers extra chilly. Also sometimes the wind affects the ball trajectory. And maybe the cemetery's proximity means the team is cursed.

<p style="font-size:large">November 9: Monochrome

<p style="font-size:13px">Most of my maps for the challenge are pretty simple and straightforward, this one might need a bit more explanation. I'm not great at monochrome mapping, stylistically speaking (I love clashing colors, the more garish the better) so I thought it best to lean on terrain mapping, where a gradient hillshade can do most of the heavy lifting.
  <br><br>
  Deciding what landscape to map, then, I found myself wondering if the Erbil Citadel would show up as terrain. The Citadel is an 80- to 100-foot high tell in the center of Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish Autonomous Region of Iraq. It looks like this on Google Earth
  <img src="images/erbil_googleearth.JPG?raw=true"/>
  and like this from the ground. I can't speak for the entire country but this part of Iraq is a lot more green that it appears from above (or on cable news).  
  <img src="images/IMG-2709.jpg?raw=true"/>
  Tells are almost like artificial terrain - they're formed from centuries of people living, building and re-building, in the same spot. The tell at the center of Erbil is thought to be the longest continually occupied human settlement - people have lived there for over 6,000 years. Though it's mostly a tourist attraction these days (as well as <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1437/">a UNESCO World Heritage site</a>), some folks do still live up there. 
  <br><br>
 So yeah I was wondering if this tallish, flat-topped, slope-sided hill would be distinct enough from the relatively flat terrain immediately surrounding it to show up in a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 1 arc second digital elevation model hillshade.
  <img src="images/erb_2.gif?raw=true"/>
  It does!!!! Here's a closer look, zoomed way in. Our little friend, like a small out-of-place mesa.  
  <img src="images/closeup.jpg?raw=true"/> 
  Question: answered. I then made a little map around it to help give a sense of what's being shown. I feel like the geography of this area is not as familiar to most folks.

  Et voila.

<p style="font-size:large">November 8: Yellow

<img src="images/8 yellow.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">When I saw <a href="https://moriartynaps.org/midnight-arrivial/">Dylan's gorgeous re-creation of flying into (or out of) a city at night</a>, I was immediately reminded of the story from a few years back around Col. Chris Hadfield's photo of Berlin from space and how, decades after reunification, the city's divide was literally visible from space in the streetlights. This was a quick one, so it's not so much a map as a georeferenced and labeled satellite image. Oh well. I still like it.
  Data from <a href="https://daten.berlin.de/">Berlin Open Data</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, image from <a href="https://twitter.com/cmdr_hadfield/status/324638635766980608?lang=en">Colonel Chris Hadfield on twitter</a>. Based on what I could translate, I am pretty sure Berlin Open Data has streetlight data, but my German is p much limited to basic conversation and not, like, technical terms.

<p style="font-size:large">November 7: Green

<img src="images/goatsnstoats.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">Today's map plan ground to a screeching halt once I saw that the New Zealand Department of Conservation (I almost typed Department of Conversation, which was a pretty good bar on K Rd like 12 years ago) Te Papa Atawhai collected data on FERAL GOATS AND STOATS.

<p style="font-size:large">November 6: Red

<img src="images/bloodfield.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">I wasn't sure what to do for this one, so I asked Taylor for ideas, and he said, "I don't know, blood?" Which led me to finding this old map of DC neighborhoods and layering that with the current spread of (blood-)red maple trees. 
  Data from <a href="https://opendata.dc.gov/">what I am now realizing is called Open Data DC and not DC GIS anymore</a> and <a href="https://ggwash.org/view/12595/meet-me-down-in-pipetown-dcs-neighborhoods-in-1877">Greater Greater Washington</a>.

<p style="font-size:13px">Above is what I posted to twitter, for legibility's sake. Below is the full map. Someone needs to tell these companies there are colors outside of North America and Europe....

<p style="font-size:large">November 4: Hexagons 

<img src="images/4 hexagons.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">This one started out as something else entirely but I am simply too committed to dumb and pointless mapping. Data from <a href="https://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/namefiles.html">GNS</a> and <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>, typeface is <a href="https://lauraworthingtondesign.com/products/collections/charcuterie">Charcuterie</a>, which I actually purchased last year for another project and am determined to get my money's worth so I'm sure it'll end up on a lot more of these as the month progresses.</p>

<p style="font-size:large">November 3: Polygons 

<img src="images/3 polygons.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">Since it's election day, I figured it was only right to do a set of congressional district polygons. Data from <a href="http://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/">http://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/</a>, typeface is again <a href="https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/typography-for-topography-belltopo-sans-free-font/">BellTopo Sans</a>. </p>

<p style="font-size:large">November 2: Lines
