## 30 Day Map Challenge
(<a href="https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge">what is the 30 day map challenge?</a>)

### November 9: Monochrome

<p style="font-size:13px">Most of my maps for the challenge are pretty simple and straightforward, this one might need a bit more explanation. I'm not great at monochrome mapping, stylistically speaking (I love clashing colors, honestly) so I thought it best to lean on terrain mapping, where a gradient hillshade can do most of the heavy lifting.
  <br>
  Deciding what landscape to map, then, I found myself wondering if the Citadel in Erbil would show up as terrain. It's an 80- to 100-foot high tell in the center of Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish Autonomous Region of Iraq. It looks like this on Google Earth
  <img src="images/erbil_googleearth.JPG?raw=true"/>
  and like this on the ground.
  <img src="images/IMG-2709.jpg?raw=true"/>
  Tells are almost like artificial terrain - they're formed from centuries of people living, building and re-building, in the same spot. The tell at the center of Erbil is thought to be the longest continually occupied human settlement - people have lived there for over 6,000 years. Though it's mostly a tourist attraction these days (as well as a UNESCO World Heritage site), some folks do still live up there. 
  <br>
 So I was wondering if this tallish, flat-topped, slope-sided hill would be distinct enough from the surrounding terrain to show up in a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 1 arc second digital elevation model hillshade.

  It does!!!! Here's a closer look, zoomed way in.

  Question: answered. I then made a little map around it to help give a sense of what's being shown.

  Et voila. Data from <a href="https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules/collection-details?p=C1000000240-LPDAAC_ECS&pg[0][gsk]=-start_date&q=SRTM&tl=1589303691!4!!">NASA SRTM</a> and <a href="https://data.humdata.org/organization/ocha-iraq">UNOCHA Iraq on Humanitarian Data Exchange</a>.

### November 8: Yellow

<img src="images/8 yellow.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">When I saw <a href="https://moriartynaps.org/midnight-arrivial/">Dylan's gorgeous re-creation of flying into (or out of) a city at night</a>, I was immediately reminded of the story from a few years back around Col. Chris Hadfield's photo of Berlin from space and how, decades after reunification, the city's divide was literally visible from space in the streetlights. This was a quick one, so it's not so much a map as a georeferenced and labeled satellite image. Oh well. I still like it.
  Data from <a href="https://daten.berlin.de/">Berlin Open Data</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, image from <a href="https://twitter.com/cmdr_hadfield/status/324638635766980608?lang=en">Colonel Chris Hadfield on twitter</a>. Based on what I could translate, I am pretty sure Berlin Open Data has streetlight data, but my German is p much limited to basic conversation and not, like, technical terms. Typeface is back to <a href="https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/typography-for-topography-belltopo-sans-free-font/">BellTopo Sans</a>!</p>

### November 7: Green

<img src="images/goatsnstoats.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">Today's map plan ground to a screeching halt once I saw that the New Zealand Department of Conservation (I almost typed Department of Conversation, which was a pretty good bar on K Rd like 12 years ago) Te Papa Atawhai collected data on FERAL GOATS AND STOATS.
  Data from <a href="https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/organization/department-of-conservation"> New Zealand Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai</a> and <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>. Typeface is <a href="https://www.dafont.com/franchise-2.font/">Franchise, also from dafont</a>.</p>

### November 6: Red

<img src="images/bloodfield.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">I wasn't sure what to do for this one, so I asked Taylor for ideas, and he said, "I don't know, blood?" Which led me to finding this old map of DC neighborhoods and layering that with the current spread of (blood-)red maple trees. 
  Data from <a href="https://opendata.dc.gov/">what I am now realizing is called Open Data DC and not DC GIS anymore</a> and <a href="https://ggwash.org/view/12595/meet-me-down-in-pipetown-dcs-neighborhoods-in-1877">Greater Greater Washington</a>. Both typefaces are from <a href="https://www.dafont.com/">dafont</a>'s warehouse of free for personal use fonts.</p>

### November 5: Blue 

<img src="images/blue.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">Above is what I posted to twitter, for legibility's sake. Below is the full map. Someone needs to tell these companies there are colors outside of North America and Europe....
<img src="images/5 blue full.jpg?raw=true"/>
  Data from <a href="https://images.sherwin-williams.com/content_images/sw-pdf-sherwin-williams-color.pdf">Sherwin-Williams</a>, <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/">Benjamin Moore</a>, <a href="https://encycolorpedia.com">Encycolorpedia</a>, and <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>. Typeface is, you guessed it, <a href="https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/typography-for-topography-belltopo-sans-free-font/">BellTopo Sans</a>.</p>

### November 4: Hexagons 

<img src="images/4 hexagons.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">This one started out as something else entirely but I am simply too committed to dumb and pointless mapping. Data from <a href="https://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/namefiles.html">GNS</a> and <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>, typeface is <a href="https://lauraworthingtondesign.com/products/collections/charcuterie">Charcuterie</a>, which I actually purchased last year for another project and am determined to get my money's worth so I'm sure it'll end up on a lot more of these as the month progresses.</p>

### November 3: Polygons 

<img src="images/3 polygons.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">Since it's election day, I figured it was only right to do a set of congressional district polygons. Data from <a href="http://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/">http://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/</a>, typeface is again <a href="https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/typography-for-topography-belltopo-sans-free-font/">BellTopo Sans</a>. </p>

### November 2: Lines 

<img src="images/2 lines.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px"> Rarely - only twelve times since 1953 - a storm will cross over from the Atlantic to the Pacific basin (or vice versa). Data from <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=ib-v4-access">NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information</a>, <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atlantic%E2%80%93Pacific_crossover_hurricanes">Wikipedia</a>.

### November 1: Points 

<img src="images/1 - points v2.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px"> I actually made this one on October 1st...too excited for the challenge I guess. Data from <a href="https://octo.dc.gov/service/dc-gis-services">DC GIS</a>. Typeface is <a href="https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/typography-for-topography-belltopo-sans-free-font/">BellTopo Sans</a>. </p>
