### November 6: Red

<img src="images/bloodfield.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">I wasn't sure what to do for this one, so I asked Taylor for ideas, and he said, "I don't know, blood?" Which led me to finding this old map of DC neighborhoods and layering that with the current spread of (blood-)red maple trees. 
  Data from <a href="https://opendata.dc.gov/">what I am now realizing is called Open Data DC and not DC GIS anymore</a> and <a href="https://ggwash.org/view/12595/meet-me-down-in-pipetown-dcs-neighborhoods-in-1877">Greater Greater Washington</a>. Both typefaces are from <a href="https://www.dafont.com/">dafont</a>'s warehouse of free for personal use fonts.</p>

### November 5: Blue 

<img src="images/blue.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">Above is what I posted to twitter, for legibility's sake. Below is the full map. Someone needs to tell these companies there are colors outside of North America and Europe....
<img src="images/5 blue full.jpg?raw=true"/>
  Data from <a href="https://images.sherwin-williams.com/content_images/sw-pdf-sherwin-williams-color.pdf">Sherwin-Williams</a>, <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/">Benjamin Moore</a>, <a href="https://encycolorpedia.com">Encycolorpedia</a>, and <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>. Typeface is, you guessed it, <a href="https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/typography-for-topography-belltopo-sans-free-font/">BellTopo Sans</a>.</p>

### November 4: Hexagons 

<img src="images/4 hexagons.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">This one started out as something else entirely but I am simply too committed to dumb and pointless mapping. Data from <a href="https://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/namefiles.html">GNS</a> and <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>, typeface is <a href="https://lauraworthingtondesign.com/products/collections/charcuterie">Charcuterie</a>, which I actually purchased last year for another project and am determined to get my money's worth so I'm sure it'll end up on a lot more of these as the month progresses.</p>

### November 3: Polygons 

<img src="images/3 polygons.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px">Since it's election day, I figured it was only right to do a set of congressional district polygons. Data from <a href="http://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/">http://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/</a>, typeface is again <a href="https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/typography-for-topography-belltopo-sans-free-font/">BellTopo Sans</a>. </p>

### November 2: Lines 

<img src="images/2 lines.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px"> Rarely - only twelve times since 1953 - a storm will cross over from the Atlantic to the Pacific basin (or vice versa). Data from <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=ib-v4-access">NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information</a>, <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atlantic%E2%80%93Pacific_crossover_hurricanes">Wikipedia</a>. Typeface is of course <a href="https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/typography-for-topography-belltopo-sans-free-font/">BellTopo Sans</a>. </p>


### November 1: Points 

<img src="images/1 - points v2.jpg?raw=true"/>
<p style="font-size:13px"> I actually made this one on October 1st...too excited for the challenge I guess. Data from <a href="https://octo.dc.gov/service/dc-gis-services">DC GIS</a>. Typeface is <a href="https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/typography-for-topography-belltopo-sans-free-font/">BellTopo Sans</a>. </p>
